<h1>What is userism?</h1>
A brief explanation. With the rise of digital automation, the social conflict based on labor will, over time, become secondary (and in many parts of the world it already is). Machines together with digital systems automate both the physical and the mental act of work. This unsettles many groups and can indeed reduce entire populations to inert masses compared to the few who own the means of production. However, it is also the opportunity for a major liberation: work that is poor, alienating, precarious, or degrading may cease to be a problem for future generations (and, to some extent, already for many people today).
<br><br>The fundamental economic conflict between people and power will instead shift to the social role of digital consumers—users. They are the only ones capable of providing both intention and value to the digital machine. “We are the consumers; we define the value of the economy,” and through our desires and choices we reshape productive flows. This power increases as digital consumers—users—can easily access the fruits of machine labor. (Granted, many people still work under the negative conditions mentioned above, but sooner or later the digital machine will replace those jobs as well.)
<br><br>The new conflict arises because users are not only active participants but also, often, passive ones, serving as sources of data extraction that feed the digital machine, for better or worse. This inevitably leads to a confrontation over users’ freedom to determine the direction of society’s value flows, opposed to the tendency of organized powers—states, companies, or other entities that will likely emerge in the future—to influence (and/or surveil) users. Only when these powers are representative of a collective user will, and thus born of democratic organizations formed by users themselves, can we be sure that the end of labor brought by automation will be, in fact, a liberation.
<br><br>Userism aims to be both an analytical framework and a practical approach, in service of users—current or emerging—across the world. Its goal is to free people from the fear of the end of work and instead propose an optimistic, positive, yet necessarily assertive vision. Naturally, I hope userist struggle will take place peacefully: a conflict, yes, but legitimized by discourse and non violent means. This point matters, because although violent revolution is always an option, it will not necessarely lead to a plural and inclusive outcome that benefits all users. In the digital era, there are plenty of tools to organize dialogue among users and peaceful conflict with accumulating powers.
<br><br>In any case, this short text does not aim to outline specific policy proposals. For that, there are many other articles on this site, or you can contribute one yourself. If you are interested, you can find us on the contact page. If not, I hope at least to have given you something to think about.
<br><br>To be clear: userism is not a registered trademark or the name of a single organization. It is an idea meant to belong to everyone, and hopefully it always will.

<h1>Cos'è l'userismo?</h1>
Lo spiego in due parole. Con l’avvento dell’automazione digitale, il conflitto sociale basato sul lavoro diventerà col tempo secondario (e lo è già in ampie parti di mondo). Questo perché le macchine assieme al digitale automatizzano sia l’atto fisico che quello mentale del lavoro. Un fatto che turba molte categorie, e che può in effetti relegare I popoli a masse inerti rispetto a chi possiede I mezzi di produzione. Tuttavia, è anche l’opportunità di una grande liberazione: il lavoro, quello povero, quello alientante, quello precario, quello degradante, potrebbe non essere più un problema per le persone del futuro (e in parte già per molte persone del presente). 
<br><br>Il conflitto economico basilare fra popolo e potere si traslerà invece sul ruolo sociale dei consumatori digitali, ovvero gli utenti. Questi sono gli unici in grado di fornire alla macchina digitale sia la volontà, sia il valore stesso. Infatti “noi siamo I consumatori, definiamo il valore dell’economia,” e proprio grazie al nostro atto di desiderare e volere, modifichiamo I flussi produttivi. Un potere che si amplifica in qualità di consumatori digitali, cioè utenti, che con estrema facilità possono accedere ai frutti del lavoro delle macchine (Posto che, ad oggi, tantissime persone continuano a lavorare nelle condizioni negative di cui sopra, ma prima o poi la macchina digitale sostituirà anche quei lavori). 
<br><br>Il conflitto però nasce dal fatto che gli utenti non sono solo parte attiva, ma anche e spesso parte passiva, in quanto fonte di estrazione di dati per nutrire la macchina digitiale, nel bene e nel male. Ciò conduce inevitabilmente a un confronto sulla libertà degli utenti di determinare la direzione dei flussi di valore della società, opposto alla tendenza di influenzare gli utenti (e/o sorvegliarli) da parte di poteri organizzati, come Stati, aziende, o altre soggettività che presumibilmente emergenanno in futuro. Solo quando questi poteri saranno rappresentativi di una volontà collettiva degli utenti, e quindi frutto di organizzazioni democratiche costituite dagli utenti stessi, potremmo stare sicuri che la fine del lavoro causata dall’automazione sarà in verità una grande liberazione.
<br><br>L’userismo si propone come strumento di analisi, ma anche di azione pratica, per servire gli utenti già effettivi o anche incipienti di ogni parte del mondo. Per liberare le persone dalla paura della fine del lavoro, e invece proporre una visione ottimista, positiva, ma necessariamente combattiva. Ovviamente, l’userismo spera che questa lotta avverrà in termini pacifici: un conflitto, sì, ma legittimato dal discorso e dalla non violenza. Porre l’accento su questo punto è importante, perché sebbene la rivoluzione resti sempre un’opzione, è difficile pensare che possa andare in una direzione plurale e inclusiva per dare a tutti gli utenti un futuro migliore. Nell’era digitale c’è spazio per il dialogo tra utenti, e per il conflitto con I poteri accumulatrici, e ci sono gli strumenti per portare avanti entrambe le strade in via civile, ma d’impatto.
<br><br>In ogni caso, questo breve testo non si propone di delineare prospettive di policy specifiche. Per questo, ci sono molti altri articoli che puoi trovare in questo sito, o che puoi contribuire tu stessa a scrivere. Se può interessarti, ci trovi nella pagine contatti. Se no, spero almeno di averti dato qualcosa a cui pensare.
<br><br>Beninteso, l’userismo non è un marchio registrato o il nome di una singola organizzazione. È un’idea che spero possa essere di tutti e che possa restarlo per sempre.</p>

                <h2>Big tech or digital democracy?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Renato Pisani, 20 november 2025<br><br>
On 21 January 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump hosted the CEOs of OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank at the White House to unveil a colossal project: Stargate. A 500-billion-dollar plan to build massive computing hubs across the country. Each hub will house hundreds of thousands of microprocessors and will be used to train the most advanced AI models. In particular, Stargate will fuel the growth of generative AI, the kind capable of producing text or images, such as ChatGPT. The project has raised concerns about its environmental and labour impact. Stargate will consume as much energy as that used by hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of Italians, and will also require large amounts of water for cooling. Yet despite the resources involved and the money invested, according to OpenAI the jobs created will number only a few tens of thousands.
<br>The aim of this article, however, is not to debate these issues, but to identify in Stargate—and in similar projects funded by other companies—a shift in the structure of digital capital and in the balance of power across society. At the heart of this shift is the role of the major tech companies, which are steering the world, willingly or not, through a turbulent phase of transformation. This change begins with their own profit model. For Big Tech, a fundamental paradigm has shifted: where they once focused on accumulating and selling data, they now treat data as raw material for a new, even more profitable production process—the development of generative AI systems. As a result, they have begun investing vast sums not only to centralise user data in data centres, but also to centralise computing power itself, which until now was distributed across users’ devices. It is a transformation within the digital sphere analogous in impact to the industrial revolution that upended large agrarian estates. Today’s generative AI is possible only thanks to the immense quantities of data accumulated during the old Internet era. But to improve and scale, it requires computing power capable of processing that data as fast as possible. The result is a further concentration of economic and political influence in the hands of the companies driving this revolution.

<br><br>The Future of Digital Profit

<br><br>These companies are the usual suspects—Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta—plus one new name: OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT. All are pouring billions into AI infrastructure and development, through projects that range from independent to deeply interconnected. Yet none of them is currently generating real financial returns. OpenAI expects its first net profit in 2029.
There is ongoing debate about whether the sky-high valuations of the AI market are largely speculative. The young OpenAI is valued at around 500 billion dollars, while Nvidia—the near-monopolist in AI chips—exceeds 5 trillion. A bubble is likely: valuations may crash, and some peripheral firms may fail. But from the perspective of Big Tech, long-term profit prospects justify every dollar spent. <br>Expected returns span strategic applications such as warfare, public administration, and healthcare. But most profits will probably continue to come from vast masses of individual digital consumers. Big Tech is betting that users will be increasingly drawn to technology that is extremely convenient and personalised, compared to the static systems of the “old digital”.
<br>AI promises dynamic, personalised digital environments, where speaking is enough to obtain almost anything—an enormous leap beyond search engines like Google or operating systems like Windows. LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini sit at the core of this offer, integrating with audio systems, graphics, and third-party apps to deliver a seamless experience. In return, through conversations with LLMs, users provide companies with extremely granular personal data. This will improve the quality of data collection in Big Tech’s hands, allowing them to refine personalised, almost intimate communication strategies to push profitable content such as advertising. Their ability to influence users will strengthen—this is the real power held by digital capital.

<br><br>Generative AI and the Degeneration of the User

<br><br>Influence underpins the strength of digital capital. Today, most Big Tech firms use this power to generate advertising revenue. Their primary tools remain social-media and search-engine algorithms which, through machine learning, adopt autonomous strategies tailored to each individual. These strategies vary in content but reduce to three basic tactics:
<br>
personalisation, to maximise time spent online;<br>
emotional stimulation, to weaken psychological defences;<br>
atomisation, the fragmentation of users into small, isolated bubbles to strengthen grip over individuals or groups, while making collective reactions harder.<br>
These patterns are not necessarily designed in advance but are behaviours AI has discovered to perform its tasks effectively, benefiting the companies.
<br>Generative AI and modern neural networks can amplify all three tactics, for example by producing content rather than merely reshuffling it. First, personalisation evolves into something fully personal. An LLM like ChatGPT is programmed to imitate its user, mirroring tone, fulfilling desires, and autonomously adopting engagement strategies. Second, emotional influence deepens, because the human–machine interaction demands less intellectual effort from the user. AI can guide the user’s experience across all forms of consumption, responding almost solely to emotional cues. Third, atomisation hardens, creating countless micro-bubbles that span the entire digital experience rather than individual apps. A pervasive AI system, functioning like an operating system, can mediate all interactions and all incoming content.
<br>It is natural for Big Tech to use these systems to expand their influence. But this trajectory risks producing a “degeneration of the user,” reducing individuals to an idealised model optimised for profit, rather than citizens suited to democratic society. If the user is not free and independent in the digital sphere, the corresponding citizen is unlikely to be fully free in the physical one. AI therefore places society at a crossroads: either toward a distributed digital infrastructure with empowered users, or toward the dominance of private profit, threatening rights beginning with labour and well-being.

<br><br>Digital Democracy and Italian Politics

<br><br>Italy, as a political and institutional system, has limited hope of reversing user degeneration or halting the concentration of digital capital, mainly for two reasons: dependence on the United States and the inertia of Italian politics.
<br>On the first point, Italy and Europe depend on the U.S. for a vast range of technologies, from operating systems to cloud services, social platforms, and AI. This dependence is a major obstacle to democratic oversight of the digital sphere. The threat of political or economic retaliation prevents democratic governments from taking radical decisions, leaving them subject—willingly or not—to opaque choices made overseas. They manage to pass only moderate measures, such as the GDPR and the AI Act, Europe’s landmark digital regulations adopted in 2016 and 2024. Though highly significant, and far more radical than the unrestrained U.S. market, they are insufficient to reverse user degeneration because they do not address infrastructure or profit structures. U.S. Big Tech remains in control of the digital sphere, acting in close coordination with the U.S. government and the Pentagon, with which it shares a long-standing, lucrative, and strengthening relationship. European regulation, however detailed, is therefore not enough. Its proposals risk being sidestepped, ignored, or weakened by future pressure, leaving European citizens with incomplete and fragile protection.
<br>Turning to Italian politics, an examination of the electoral programmes for the 2024 European Parliament elections reveals a lack of major ideas. Overall, the Five-Star Movement offers the most wide-ranging vision, linking digital issues to many dimensions of human life, though its proposals remain focused on specific risks such as cyberbullying or the environment. The Democratic Party shows the greatest concern for democratic control, offering significant proposals such as entrusting data centres to non-profits to ensure transparent, Big-Tech-free data storage. Still, no programme outlines a vision that connects all elements of digital and AI transformation. No party appears concerned about user degeneration or the centralisation of computing power—crucial factors in reshaping the trajectory of private digital development.

<br><br>Four Principles for Digital Democracy

<br><br>In the absence of political will, initiative falls to citizens. A vision of digital democracy is needed—one capable of sparking public interest and laying the groundwork for user emancipation. Below are several principles that could help frame a radical yet concrete discussion.
<br>First, users must not be exploited. Digital activities should be based on the assumption that data is not collected for profit, unless through systems ensuring direct economic redistribution to citizens. Transparency and open-source approaches should be mandatory for any platform adopting data-for-profit model.
<br>Second, users must not be manipulated. Hyper-personalisation in social media and AI should be phased out. AI-generated content should always self-identify as such, cite its sources, and avoid personal or friendly tones that trigger emotional responses. Social-media feeds should be less strategic and anchored to transparent criteria to reduce addiction and atomisation.
<br>Third, digital infrastructure must be distributed. Computing power should be shared among public institutions, private companies, individuals, and civil society, preventing Stargate-style centralisation. Local communities should have the authority to decide whether and when to build computing hubs or data centres, with substantial control and direct economic benefit.
<br>Fourth, the people must retain control. A digital supply chain should be built to be as autonomous and barrier-free as possible, ensuring democratic control flows through local institutions rather than foreign governments or private corporations. National and supranational democratic governments should commit fully to making this right a reality.
