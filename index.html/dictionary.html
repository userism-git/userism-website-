          <h2>Automation</h2>
          <p>Automation is the capacity of a human-designed process to operate without further human action once started. 
            It lets humans set a goal and reach it with little effort. With digital technology, complex intellectual processes can now be automated, 
            on top of mechanical or logistical ones. Yet automation demands advanced digital capabilities and resources, 
            which can allow few organizations to monopolize its most resource-intensive capabilities, 
            potentially excluding people from parts of derived benefits.</p>

          <h2>Data</h2>
          <p>Information in digital form is what we call data. Data is information that can be read by machines, 
            it can become instructions, can be replicated infinitely and accessed easily. 
            Every piece of information can be digitalized, and therefore digital systems tend to digitalize as much information as possible, 
            since data is the basic resource of any digital system.</p>
